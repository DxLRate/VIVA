 Memory Management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer 
memory, assigning portions known as blocks to various running programs to optimize the 
overall performance of the system. 

There are different Placement Algorithm:
**************  first fit ******************
1. First Fit: In the first fit, the partition is allocated which is the first sufficient block from the 
top of Main Memory. It scans memory from the beginning and chooses the first available block 
that is large enough. Thus, it allocates the first hole that is large enough.

******************* next fit ********************
4. Next Fit: Next fit is similar to the first fit but it will search for the first sufficient partition 
from the last allocation point.


************************** worst fit *******************
3. Worst Fit Allocate the process to the partition which is the largest sufficient among the 
freely available partitions available in the main memory. It is opposite to the best-fit algorithm. 
It searches the entire list of holes to find the largest hole and allocate it to process. 

************************* best fit ***********************
2. Best Fit Allocate the process to the partition which is the first smallest sufficient partition 
among the free available partition. It searches the entire list of holes to find the smallest hole 
whose size is greater than or equal to the size of the process.
